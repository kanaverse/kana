# Kana: Single cell analysis in the browser

*Kana* comes from the [Telugu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telugu_language) word [kaṇaṁ (కణం)](https://www.shabdkosh.com/dictionary/english-telugu/%E0%B0%95%E0%B0%A3%E0%B0%82/%E0%B0%95%E0%B0%A3%E0%B0%82-meaning-in-telugu), which means ...  drumroll... ***cell***

## Overview

[Checkout our preprint on bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.03.02.482701v1)

**kana** is a web application for single-cell data analysis that works directly in the browser.
That's right - the calculations are performed client-side, by your browser, on your computer!
This differs from the usual paradigm of, e.g., Shiny applications where data needs to be sent to a backend server that does the actual analysis.
Our client-side approach has a number of advantages:

- Your data is never transferred anywhere, so you don't have have to worry about problems with data privacy.
  These can be especially hairy when your backend server lies in a different jurisdiction from your data source.
  By performing the analysis on the client, we avoid all of these issues.
- **kana** is super-cheap to run and deploy, just serve it as a static website.
  There's no need to maintain a server or cloud compute instance - let the user's machine take care of it.
  It also naturally scales to any number of users as they're automatically providing the compute.
- By removing network latency, we can achieve a smooth interactive experience.
  This ranges from steps such as animated dimensionality reductions to user-driven marker detection and celltype annotation.

## For users

If you have a Matrix Market (`.mtx`) file or HDF5 (tenx V3 or `AnnData` representation stored as h5ad), or `SummarizedExperiment` (or derivatives like `SingleCellExperiment`) stored as an RDS file, or an [ExperimentHub](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ExperimentHub.html) id, you're ready to go.

1. Launch the application by clicking [**here**](https://www.kanaverse.org/kana/).
2. Select the Matrix Market file (this may be Gzip-compressed).
   We recommend also providing the corresponding `genes.tsv` or `features.tsv` file to identify marker genes properly.
3. Click the "Analyze" button, and we'll run a standard single-cell analysis for you.

The standard analysis follows the flow described in the [**Orchestrating Single-Cell Analysis with Bioconductor**](https://bioconductor.org/books/release/OSCA/).
Briefly, this involves:

- Removal of low-quality cells 
- Normalization and log-transformation
- Modeling of the mean-variance trend across genes
- A principal components analysis on the highly variable genes
- Clustering with graph-based methods
- The usual dimensionality reductions (t-SNE/UMAP)
- Marker detection for each cluster
- Compute gene set enrichment for each cluster
- Support Multi-modal analysis for Cite-seq data and/or CRISPR
- Make custom cell selections and detect markers for this selection
- Cell type annotation for each cluster across user selected reference datasets
- Perform Integration or Batch correction using MNN correction. You can provide a single dataset containing multiple batches and specify the `batch` column in the cell annotations, or load multiple datasets where each dataset is considered a batch
- Perform analysis on subsets (filter based on cell annotation)

The interface provides a depiction of the dimensionality reduction of choice,
a ranking of marker genes for the cluster of interest,
and diagnostic plots from the individual analysis steps.

**Tips and tricks:**

- Clicking on a cluster name in the legend will highlight that cluster in the t-SNE/UMAP plot.
- Clicking on the droplet icon in the marker table will color the t-SNE/UMAP plot by the expression of the selected gene.
- Clicking on the plus icon in the marker table will give some details about that gene's expression in the selected cluster, including a histogram relative to cells in other clusters.
- Hovering over the bars in the Markers section for a gene displays a tooltip on different statistics for that gene vs the selected cluster.
- Filter markers either by searching for a gene or using the sliders to filter by various statistics.
- Clicking on Save in the t-SNE or UMAP section will capture the current state of the visualization to Gallery
- Clicking on Animate will interactively visualize dimensions at various iterations as the t-SNE or UMAP algorithms computes these embeddings
- Clicking on "What's happening" will show logs describing how long each step of the analysis took (and any errors during the analysis).
- Clicking Export will save the analysis either to the browser or download the analysis as a .kana file. Loading these files will restore the state of the application

## For developers

### Deployment 

Deployment is as easy as serving the static files in this repository via HTTPS.
Indeed, our [**deployment**](https://kanaverse.org/kana/) is just being served via GitHub Pages.
As promised, there's no need to set up a backend server.

### Architecture

***We have significantly revamped the entire application and the underlying infrastructure to support hybrid compute - either purely client-side with webassembly, or on backend systems through node, or both.***

**kana** uses the [**scran.js**](https://github.com/kanaverse/scran.js) library for efficient client-side execution of single-cell analysis steps.
This uses a variety of C/C++ libraries compiled to [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) to enable heavy-duty calculations in the browser at near-native speed.

<!--
Traditional data analysis applications use ***function shipping***, where a client (or an application in the browser) wants to perform an operation on a dataset on a backend server.
The client makes an API call to the server asking it to compute a function, the server responds with the results of the operation and the client/app displays them. 
In **kana**, we replace the server with the users's own laptop/machine. 
-->

All computations performed by **kana** run in a [Web Worker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers).
This avoids blocking on the main thread and allows the application to be more responsive.
Data is sent to the main thread on an as-needed basis, e.g., for visualizations. 
We also create separate Web Workers for the t-SNE and UMAP steps so that they can be run concurrently for maximum efficiency.

![Worker Model](assets/scran.js.app.workers.png)

The WASM code itself is compiled with PThreads support to enable parallelization of some analysis steps.
This involves the use of a [`SharedArrayBuffer`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/SharedArrayBuffer) to efficiently share memory across Web Workers,
which in turn requires cross origin isolation of the site.
We achieve this by using a service worker to cache the resources and load the blobs with the relevant headers - hence the need for HTTPS.

### Friends of Kana

 
- [ba***kana***](https://github.com/kanaverse/bakana): The core analysis workflow is refactored into an independent package to provide the same functionality in browser and node environments. The Kana front-end is now a wrapper around bakana.
- [***kana***pi](https://github.com/kaanverse/kanapi): provides a node API (using WebSockets) to run single-cell analysis in backend environments (extending `bakana`). One can extend **Kana** to interact to this API (#good-first-issue)
- [***kana***-formats](https://github.com/kanaverse/kana-formats): as we add new functionality and features, we need to store and read the exported analysis state (`.kana` files). This package specifies the formats and provides readers for parsing various versions.
- [***kana***val](https://github.com/kanaverse/kanaval): validate the exported analysis results.

### Contributing

Install dependencies:

```
npm install or yarn # depending on what you use
```

To start the app:

```
yarn start # if using yarn, highly recommended
npm run start # if using npm
```

This usually runs on port 3000 unless something else is already running on the same port.

For the curious: this project was bootstrapped with the [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
